2. A list of technical question [here](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/data-science-interviews/blob/master/technical.md#sql), which includes SQL, python and algorithms.
3. [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/sql-interview-questions/) offers a long list of scenario SQL questions one can study from along with practice with a couple of multiple choice questions.
4. [Pgexcercises](https://pgexercises.com/) is a good platform that provides a dataset and an extensive series of postgreSQL queries to practice with.
5. [This article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/questions-sql-for-all-aspiring-data-scientists/) provides 42 SQL questions one can study from.
